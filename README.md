Migrate Spotify
---

This project is a result from wanting to delete facebook but not being able
to since Spotify doesn't allow transfer of accounts that have facebook linked to email
addresses. **PLEASE FIX THIS SPOTIFY, THIS TOOK HOURS OF MY LIFE AWAY**. Anyways, the design
of this application is to populate a new account with an existing account's data (folled artists, 
playlists and library tracks). Some things like collaborative playlists can't be "ported".
